Add Defyne (Fyne UI designer)
- Install the Defyne tool:
  - Windows PowerShell:
    - Ensure a C compiler is available for CGO (e.g., install MSYS2 and `mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc`).
    - Install Defyne binary:
      `go install github.com/fyne-io/defyne@latest`
- Track Defyne in go.mod (already set up via `tools/tools.go`). Run:
  `go mod tidy`
- Launch Defyne:
  - From terminal in the project root: `defyne`
  - Or from the app menu: Tools â†’ Open Defyne

Notes
- If `defyne` is not recognized, ensure `GOPATH/bin` is in your PATH. On Windows that is typically `C:\Users\<you>\go\bin`.
