Formula based calculation based on user import
Provide option to switch between imperial or metric

Convert your height from centimeters to meters 
(e.g., 170 cm = 1.7 m). 
Square your height in meters 
(1.7 m × 1.7 m = 2.89 m²). 
Divide your weight in kilograms by the squared height in meters 
(e.g., 70 kg ÷ 2.89 m² = 24.2 BMI)
